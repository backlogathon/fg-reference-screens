# fg-reference-screens

## Purpose

If you broadcast fighting game events, you probably use layouts to show scores and other match information. And you don't want those layouts to obscure important game information your viewers need to see, like meters, character names, and other information.

This repository contains lots and lots of screenshots of as many fighting games as I could find, sorted to help you use them in planning your layouts.

## Resource Conventions

All screens are at maximum resolution. All HUD elements are in default positions. Screens are taken using the "primary" tournament platform for any given game, which for most games is the PlayStation 4.

## Contributing

If you need something that's not here, please file an issue. If you have screenshots to contribute, please file a pull request, obeying the naming conventions already in place.
